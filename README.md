# Catangular

Catangular aims to create a web component that displays a random cat image fetched from tehcatapi.com.

Currently it is in development state and only ships a buggy website displaying the buggy component.

This Project is developed in a weekly Angular TDD Randori (@neusta), yet it welcomes pull requests from other contributers.
